/*
Write a simple program that prompts the user for a distance, then asks the user
for a unit of measurement (k) for kilometers,  (m) for miles.  
After they submit the information, calculate the response: 
    If miles, convert to km. If km, convert to miles. If they enter something other than k or m, print 
    You goofed!

Then ask them if they want to do another (Y/N). If they answer Y, repeat, 
if N, exit.

(distance in kilometers) ≈ distance in miles / 0.62137
(distance in miles) ≈ 0.6214 * (distance in kilometers)
